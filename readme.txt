CMS Commander makes it possible to manage all your WordPress weblogs from a single dashboard.

== Description ==

[CMS Commander](http://cmscommander.com/ "Manage multiple WordPress weblogs") allows you to manage multiple WordPress weblogs from a single powerful dashboard. Do everything you can normally do in your WP-admin, just for all your weblogs simultaneously: Bulk plugin installation, bulk posting, install updates on all sites, create backups, clone blogs and much more.

And if that is not enough CMS Commander does also include a full content and advertising solution: We have integrated over 20 different APIs, which provide diverse content you can insert into your posts with a few clicks. Easily find a image from the countless photos on Flickr to use as featured image, insert a related Youtube video into your post or include affiliate ads from Amazon to earn commission are just a few of the many possible uses!

Some of our main features:

*  Powerful dashboard to have all your websites below your fingertips.
*  One-click WordPress, plugin and theme updates across all your blogs.
*  Install a new theme or plugin to multiple weblogs in bulk.
*  Scheduled automatic backups uploaded to your Amazon S3, Google Drive or Dropbox accounts.
*  Over 20 APIs provide affiliate ads, images, videos or other useful free content you can use.
*  Google Analytics integration: View aggregated stats of your whole network.
*  Uptime monitoring, bulk update posts, bulk create new user accounts and more!
